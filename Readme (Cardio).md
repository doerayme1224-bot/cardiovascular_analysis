### Heart Disease Prediction Dataset



This repository contains a subset of the Heart Disease Data. Originating from different source databases, this dataset has been widely used since its creation in 1988 for predictive modeling.



##### Dataset Overview



    **Source:** The dataset is a compilation from four separate medical centers: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital (Zurich), and V.A. Medical Center (Long Beach).



    Attributes: While the original dataset contains 76 attributes, all published experiments and this project focus on a subset of 14 key features. Patient identifiers, such as names and social security numbers, have been replaced with dummy values for privacy.



    **Target Variable:** The target field is the binary class variable indicating the presence of heart disease.



        0: No heart disease



        1: Presence of heart disease





##### Attribute Information



The following is a list of the 14 attributes used in the dataset:



    age: Age of the patient.



    sex: Gender of the patient.



    cp: Chest pain type (4 categories).



    trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm/Hg).



    chol: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl).



    fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl).



    restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (3 categories).



    thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.



    exang: Exercise-induced angina.



    oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.



    slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.



    ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.



    thal: A blood disorder called Thalassemia (3 categories: normal, fixed defect, reversible defect).
